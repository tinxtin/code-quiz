# code-quiz

## Description
This application is a quiz questionnaire game that asks questions on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The quiz is timed and every wrong answer will deduct the time further. The quiz ends when all the questions are answered or the if the timer reaches 0. The scoring system is based on the time, thus the quicker the the user finishes answering correctly, the higher the score is. When the quiz ends the final score will be shown and the user then can enter their initial and submit their score which will get stored locally in the localstorage of the browser.
